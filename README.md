# EmbeddingHyperbolic

This is a repository to investigate how to generate music based in Hyperbolic Embeddings

## Summary


Euclidean Space is a generalization of the space we live in, which has zero curvature. Lately, some investigations have show that, negative curvature space, a.k.a. Hyperbolic Space, has some properties that can be exploited for hierarchical data in deep learning.

On this repository we explore and show where Hyperbolic layers can be usefull to improve some deep learning task. Here are two folders:

- **TorchExperiments**: This folder contains the experiments and models done with PyTorch
- **HyperbolicTImbrenet**: This folders contain the timbrenet model of Agustin Macaya, and our experiments applying hyperobolic layers to the model.
