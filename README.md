# EmbeddingHyperbolic

This is a repository to investigate how to generate music based in Hyperbolic Embeddings

Here are two folders:

- torchExperiments: This folder contains the experiments and models done with PyTorch
- HyperbolicTImbrenet: This folders contain the timbrenet model of Agustin Macaya, and our experiments applying hyperobolic layers to the model.
